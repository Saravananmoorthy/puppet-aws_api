##Overview

This module provides a bridge allowing you to setup Amazon Web Services resources (such as VPCs and Subnets) using the puppet DSL.

##Module Description



If applicable, this section should have a brief description of the technology the module integrates with and what that integration enables. This section should answer the questions: "What does this module *do*?" and "Why would I use it?"

If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration, management, etc.) this is the time to mention it.

##Setup

###What aws_api affects

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter, impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form. 

###Setup Requirements

Pluginsync must be enabled to use this module.

###Beginning with aws_api

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running. 

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps for upgrading, you may wish to include an additional section here: Upgrading (For an example, see http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/firewall).

##Usage

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing the fancy stuff with your module here. 

## Types Reference

### aws_vpc

### aws_subnet 

##Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.

##Development
